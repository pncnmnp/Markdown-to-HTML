This blog is written using a Markdown parser I just created. The indentation supported in my entire website is about 160mm or something.
Thought I would automate my **blogging** platform.

For my usual blogs, visit [pncnmnp.github.io](https://pncnmnp.github.io/blogs/blog.html). Here you will find blogs with contexts like _privacy_, _computer architecture_ and some _personal updates_.

_That's it Folks!_
_Bye_
